title: "pnpm patch-commit <path>"
---

Generate a patch out of a directory and save it (inspired by a similar command in Yarn).

This command will compare the changes from `path` to the package it was supposed to patch, generate a patch file, save the a patch file to `patchesDir` (which can be customized by the `--patches-dir` option), and add an entry to `patchesDependencies` in the top level manifest file.

Usage:

```sh
pnpm patch-commit <path>
```

* `path` is the path to a modified copy of the patch target package, it is usually a temporary directory generated by [`pnpm patch`](./patch).

## Options

### ---patches-dir &lt;patchesDir>

The generated patch file will be saved to this directory. By default, patches are saved to the `patches` directory in the root of the project.
