Prepare a package for patching (inspired by a similar command in Yarn).

This command will cause a package to be extracted in a temporary directory intended to be editable at will.

Once you're done with your changes, run `pnpm patch-commit <path>` (with `<path>` being the temporary directory you received) to generate a patchfile and register it into your top-level manifest via the [`patchedDependencies`] field.

Usage:

```
pnpm patch <pkg name>@<version>
```

[`patchedDependencies`]: ../package_json.md#pnpmpatcheddependencies

:::note

If you want to change the dependencies of a package, don't use patching to modify the `package.json` file of the package. For overriding dependencies, use [overrides] or a [package hook].

:::

[overrides]: ../package_json#pnpmoverrides
[package hook]: ../pnpmfile#hooksreadpackagepkg-context-pkg--promisepkg
