## Commands

### pnpm store add

Added in: v2.12.0

```text
pnpm store add &lt;pkg>...
```

Adds new packages to the pnpm store directly. 
Does not modify any projects or files outside the store.

```

### pnpm store prune

```sh
pnpm store prune
```

Pruning the store is not harmful, but might slow down future installations.
