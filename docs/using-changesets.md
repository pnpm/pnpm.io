title: Using Changesets with pnpm
---

:::note

At the time of writing this documentation, the latest pnpm version was
v6.14. The latest [Changesets](https://github.com/atlassian/changesets) version was v2.16.0.

:::

## Setup

To setup changesets on a pnpm workspace, install changesets as a dev dependency
in the root of the workspace:

```sh
pnpm add -DW @changesets/cli
```

Then changesets' init command:

```sh
pnpm changeset init
```

## Adding new changesets

To generate a new changeset, run `pnpm changeset` in the root of the repository.
The generated markdown files in the `.changeset` directory should be committed
to the repository.

## Releasing changes

1. Run `pnpm changeset version`. This will bump the versions of the packages
   previously specified with `pnpm changeset` (and any dependents of those) and
   update the changelog files.
2. Run `pnpm install`. This will update the lockfile and rebuild packages.
3. Commit the changes.
4. Run `pnpm publish -r`. This command will publish all packages that have
   bumped versions not yet present in the registry.

## Using GitHub Actions

To automate the process, you can use `changeset version` with GitHub actions.

### Bump up package versions

The action will detect when changeset files arrive in the `main` branch, and then open a new PR listing all the packages with bumped versions. Once merged, the packages will be updated and you can decide whether to publish or not by adding the `publish` property.

### Publishing

By adding `publish: pnpm ci:publish` which is a script that executes `changeset publish`
will publish to the registry once the PR is opened by `changeset version`.

```yaml
