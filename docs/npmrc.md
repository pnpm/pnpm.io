title: "Authentication Settings"
---

The settings on this page contain sensitive credentials and are stored in INI-formatted files. Do not commit these files to your repository.

For non-sensitive settings (proxy, SSL, registries, etc.), see [Settings (pnpm-workspace.yaml)](./settings.md).

## Auth file locations

pnpm reads authentication settings from the following files, in order of priority (highest first):

1. **`<workspace root>/.npmrc`** — project-level auth. This file should be listed in `.gitignore`.
2. **`<pnpm config>/auth.ini`** — the primary user-level auth file. `pnpm login` writes tokens here.
3. **`~/.npmrc`** — read as a fallback for easier migration from npm. Use the [`npmrcAuthFile`](./settings.md#npmrcauthfile) setting to point to a different file.

The `<pnpm config>` directory is:

* If the **$XDG_CONFIG_HOME** env variable is set: **$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/pnpm/**
* On Windows: **~/AppData/Local/pnpm/config/**
* On macOS: **~/Library/Preferences/pnpm/**
* On Linux: **~/.config/pnpm/**

## Authentication Settings

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;_authToken

Define the authentication bearer token to use when accessing the specified
registry. For example:

```ini
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You may also use an environment variable. For example:

```ini
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${NPM_TOKEN}
```

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;tokenHelper

A token helper is an executable which outputs an auth token. This can be used in situations where the authToken is not a constant value but is something that refreshes regularly, where a script or other tool can use an existing refresh token to obtain a new access token.

The configuration for the path to the helper must be an absolute path, with no arguments. In order to be secure, it is only permitted to set this value in the user `.npmrc`. Otherwise a project could place a value in a project's local `.npmrc` and run arbitrary executables.

Setting a token helper for the default registry:

```ini
tokenHelper=/home/ivan/token-generator
```

Setting a token helper for the specified registry:

```
//registry.corp.com:tokenHelper=/home/ivan/token-generator
```

## Certificate Settings

### ca

* Default: **The npm CA certificate**
* Type: **String, Array or null**

The Certificate Authority signing certificate that is trusted for SSL
connections to the registry. Values should be in PEM format (AKA
"Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)"). For example:

```sh
ca="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nXXXX\nXXXX\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```

Set to null to only allow known registrars, or to a specific CA cert to trust
only that specific signing authority.

Multiple CAs can be trusted by specifying an array of certificates:

```sh
ca[]="..."
ca[]="..."
```

See also the [`strictSsl`](./settings.md#strictssl) setting.

### cafile

* Default: **null**
* Type: **path**

A path to a file containing one or multiple Certificate Authority signing
certificates. Similar to the `ca` setting, but allows for multiple CAs, as well
as for the CA information to be stored in a file instead of being specified via
CLI.

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;cafile

Define the path to a Certificate Authority file to use when accessing the specified
registry. For example:

```sh
//registry.npmjs.org/:cafile=ca-cert.pem
```

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;ca

Added in: v10.25.0

Define an inline Certificate Authority certificate for the specified registry.
The value must be PEM-encoded, like the global `ca` setting, but it only applies
to the matching registry URL.

```sh
//registry.example.com/:ca=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### cert

* Default: **null**
* Type: **String**

A client certificate to pass when accessing the registry. Values should be in
PEM format (AKA "Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)"). For example:

```test
cert="-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nXXXX\nXXXX\n-----END CERTIFICATE-----"
```

It is not the path to a certificate file.

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;cert

Added in: v10.25.0

Define an inline client certificate to use when accessing the specified
registry. Example:

```sh
//registry.example.com/:cert=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;certfile

Define the path to a certificate file to use when accessing the specified
registry. For example:

```sh
//registry.npmjs.org/:certfile=server-cert.pem
```

### key

* Default: **null**
* Type: **String**

A client key to pass when accessing the registry. Values should be in PEM format
(AKA "Base-64 encoded X.509 (.CER)"). For example:

```sh
key="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nXXXX\nXXXX\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
```

It is not the path to a key file. Use `<URL>&#58;keyfile` if you need to reference
the file system instead of inlining the key.

This setting contains sensitive information. Don't write it to a local `.npmrc` file committed to the repository.

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;key

Added in: v10.25.0

Define an inline client key for the specified registry URL.

```sh
//registry.example.com/:key=-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----...-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
```

### &lt;URL&gt;&#58;keyfile

Define the path to a client key file to use when accessing the specified
registry. For example:

```sh
//registry.npmjs.org/:keyfile=server-key.pem
```
