title: How peers are resolved
---

One of the best features of pnpm is that in one project, a specific version of a
package will always have one set of dependencies. There is one exception from
this rule, though - packages with [peer dependencies].

[peer dependencies]: https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json#peerdependencies

Peer dependencies are resolved from dependencies installed higher in the
dependency graph, since they share the same version as their parent. That means
that if `foo@1.0.0` has two peers (`bar@^1` and `baz@^1`) then it might have
multiple different sets of dependencies in the same project.

```text
- foo-parent-1
  - bar@1.0.0
  - baz@1.0.0
  - foo@1.0.0
- foo-parent-2
  - bar@1.0.0
  - baz@1.1.0
  - foo@1.0.0
```

In the example above, `foo@1.0.0` is installed for `foo-parent-1` and
`foo-parent-2`. Both packages have `bar` and `baz`as well, but they depend on
different versions of `baz`. As a result, `foo@1.0.0` has two different sets of
dependencies: one with `baz@1.0.0` and the other one with `baz@1.1.0`. To
support these use cases, pnpm has to hard link `foo@1.0.0` as many times as
there are different dependency sets.

Normally, if a package does not have peer dependencies, it is hard linked to a
`node_modules` folder next to symlinks of its dependencies, like so:

```text
node_modules
└── .pnpm
    ├── foo@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── foo
    │       ├── qux   -> ../../qux@1.0.0/node_modules/qux
    │       └── plugh -> ../../plugh@1.0.0/node_modules/plugh
    ├── qux@1.0.0
    ├── plugh@1.0.0
```

However, if `foo` has peer dependencies, there may be multiple sets of
dependencies for it, so we create different sets for different peer dependency
resolutions:

```text
node_modules
└── .pnpm
    ├── foo@1.0.0_bar@1.0.0+baz@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── foo
    │       ├── bar   -> ../../bar@1.0.0/node_modules/bar
    │       ├── baz   -> ../../baz@1.0.0/node_modules/baz
    │       ├── qux   -> ../../qux@1.0.0/node_modules/qux
    │       └── plugh -> ../../plugh@1.0.0/node_modules/plugh
    ├── foo@1.0.0_bar@1.0.0+baz@1.1.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── foo
    │       ├── bar   -> ../../bar@1.0.0/node_modules/bar
    │       ├── baz   -> ../../baz@1.1.0/node_modules/baz
    │       ├── qux   -> ../../qux@1.0.0/node_modules/qux
    │       └── plugh -> ../../plugh@1.0.0/node_modules/plugh
    ├── foo@1.0.0
    ├── bar@1.0.0
    ├── baz@1.0.0
    ├── baz@1.1.0
    ├── qux@1.0.0
    ├── plugh@1.0.0
```

We create symlinks either to the `foo` that is inside
`foo@1.0.0_bar@1.0.0+baz@1.0.0` or to the one in
`foo@1.0.0_bar@1.0.0+baz@1.1.0`.
As a consequence, the Node.js module resolver will find the correct peers.

*If a package has no peer dependencies but has dependencies with peers that are
resolved higher in the graph*, then that transitive package can appear in the
project with different sets of dependencies. For instance, there's package
`a@1.0.0` with a single dependency `b@1.0.0`. `b@1.0.0` has a peer dependency
`c@^1`. `a@1.0.0` will never resolve the peers of `b@1.0.0`, so it becomes
dependent from the peers of `b@1.0.0` as well.

Here's how that structure will look in `node_modules`. In this example,
`a@1.0.0` will need to appear twice in the project's `node_modules` - resolved
once with `c@1.0.0` and again with `c@1.1.0`.

```text
node_modules
└── .pnpm
    ├── a@1.0.0_c@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── a
    │       └── b -> ../../b@1.0.0_c@1.0.0/node_modules/b
    ├── a@1.0.0_c@1.1.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── a
    │       └── b -> ../../b@1.0.0_c@1.1.0/node_modules/b
    ├── b@1.0.0_c@1.0.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── b
    │       └── c -> ../../c@1.0.0/node_modules/c
    ├── b@1.0.0_c@1.1.0
    │   └── node_modules
    │       ├── b
    │       └── c -> ../../c@1.1.0/node_modules/c
    ├── a@1.0.0
    ├── b@1.0.0
    ├── c@1.0.0
    ├── c@1.1.0
```
