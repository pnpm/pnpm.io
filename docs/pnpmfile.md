title: pnpmfile.js
---

pnpm allows to step directly into the installation process via special functions called *hooks*.
Hooks can be declared in a file called `pnpmfile.js`.

By default, `pnpmfile.js` should be located in the same directory in which the lockfile is.
So in a [workspace](workspaces) with a shared lockfile, the `pnpmfile.js` should be in the root
of the monorepo.

## Hooks

### tl;dr

|Option|Meaning|
|--|--|
|`hooks.readPackage(pkg, context): pkg` | Allows to mutate every dependency's `package.json` |
|`hooks.afterAllResolved(lockfile, context): lockfile` | Is called after resolution stage. Allows to mutate the lockfile object. |

### `hooks.readPackage(pkg, context): pkg`

Allows to mutate every dependency's `package.json`.
An example of a `pnpmfile.js` that changes the dependencies field of a dependency:
You will need to delete the `pnpm-lock.yaml` if you have already resolved the dependency you want change.

```js
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    readPackage
  }
}

function readPackage (pkg, context) {
  // Override the manifest of foo@1 after downloading it from the registry
  // Replace all dependencies with bar@2
  if (pkg.name === 'foo' && pkg.version.startsWith('1.')) {
    pkg.dependencies = {
      ...pkg.dependencies,
      bar: '^2.0.0'
    }
    context.log('bar@1 => bar@2 in dependencies of foo')
  }
  
  // This will fix any dependencies on baz to 1.2.3
  if (pkg.dependencies.baz === '*') {
    pkg.dependencies.baz = '1.2.3';
  }
  
  return pkg
}
```

#### Arguments

* `pkg` - _Manifest_ - The manifest of the package. Either the response from the registry or the `package.json` content.
* `context.log(msg)` - _Function_ - Allows to log messages.

#### Usage

##### Substitute a package with your fork

Lets' suppose you forked a package with an important fix and you want the fixed
version installed.

The following hook substitutes `resolve` with `@zkochan`'s fork.

```js
'use strict'
module.exports = {
  hooks: { readPackage }
}

function readPackage (pkg) {
  if (pkg.dependencies.resolve) {
    pkg.dependencies.resolve = 'zkochan/node-resolve'
  }

  return pkg
}
```

##### Packages validation

You want only packages with MIT license in your `node_modules`? Check the licenses
and throw an exception if you don't like the package's license:

```js
'use strict'
module.exports = {
  hooks: { readPackage }
}

function readPackage (pkg) {
  if (pkg.license !== 'MIT') {
    throw new Error('Invalid license!')
  }

  return pkg
}
```

##### Renaming bins

You want to rename a package's bin? Just replace it:

```js
'use strict'
module.exports = {
  hooks: { readPackage }
}

function readPackage (pkg) {
  if (pkg.name === 'eslint') {
    pkg.bin = { jslint: pkg.bin }
  }

  return pkg
}
```

Now you can run `jslint fix` instead of `eslint fix`.

### `hooks.afterAllResolved(lockfile, context): lockfile`

Added in: v1.41.0

Is called after resolution stage. Allows to mutate the lockfile object.

#### Arguments

* `lockfile` - _object_ - The object that is saved to `pnpm-lock.yaml`.
* `context.log(msg)` - _Function_ - Allows to log messages.

#### Usage

```js
module.exports = {
  hooks: { afterAllResolved }
}

function afterAllResolved (lockfile, context) {
  // ...
  return lockfile
}
```

## Configs

### ignore-pnpmfile

Added in: v1.25.0

* Default: **false**
* Type: **Boolean**

`pnpmfile.js` will be ignored. Useful together with `--ignore-scripts` when you want to make sure that
no script gets executed during install.

### pnpmfile

Added in: v1.39.0

* Default: **pnpmfile.js**
* Type: **path**
* Example: **.pnpm/pnpmfile.js**

The location of the local pnpmfile.

### global-pnpmfile

Added in: v1.39.0

* Default: **null**
* Type: **path**
* Example: **~/.pnpm/global_pnpmfile.js**

The location of a global pnpmfile. A global pnpmfile is used by all projects during installation.

**NOTE:** It is recommended to use local pnpmfiles. Only use a global pnpmfile, if you use pnpm on projects
that don't use pnpm as the primary package manager.
