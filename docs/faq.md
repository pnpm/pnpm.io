## Why does my `node_modules` folder use disk space if packages are stored in a global store?

pnpm creates [hard links] from the global store to the project's `node_modules`
folders. Hard links point to the same place on the disk where the original
files are. So, for example, if you have `foo` in your project as a dependency
and it occupies 1MB of space, then it will look like it occupies 1MB of space in
the project's `node_modules` folder and the same amount of space in the global
store. However, that 1MB is *the same space* on the disk addressed from two
different locations. So in total `foo` occupies 1MB, not 2MB.

## Does it work on Windows?

Short answer: Yes
Long answer: Using symbolic linking on Windows is problematic to say the least,
however, pnpm has a workaround. For Windows, we use [junctions] instead.

[junctions]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/hard-links-and-junctions

## But the nested `node_modules` approach is incompatible with Windows?

Early versions of npm had issues because of nesting all `node_modules` (see
[this issue]. However, pnpm does not create deep folders, it stores all packages
flatly and uses hard links to create the dependency tree structure.

## What about circular symlinks?

Although pnpm uses linking to put dependencies into `node_modules` folders,
circular symlinks are avoided because parent packages are placed into the same
`node_modules` folder in which their dependencies are. So `foo`'s dependencies
are not in `foo/node_modules`, but `foo` is in `node_modules` together with its
own dependencies.

## Why have hard links at all? Why not symlink directly to the global store?

One package can have different sets of dependencies on one machine.

In project **A** `foo@1.0.0` can have a dependency resolved to `bar@1.0.0`, but
in project **B** the same dependency of `foo` might resolve to `bar@1.1.0`; so,
pnpm hard links `foo@1.0.0` to every project where it is used, in order to
create different sets of dependencies for it.

Direct symlinking to the global store would work with Node's
`--preserve-symlinks` flag, however, that approach comes with a plethora of its
own issues, so we decided to stick with hard links. For more details about why
this decision was made, see [this issue][eps-issue].

## Does pnpm work across multiple drives or filesystems?

The package store should be on the same drive and filesystem as installations,
otherwise packages will be copied, not linked. This is due to a limitation in
how hard linking works, in that a file on one filesystem cannot address a
location in another. See [Issue #712] for more details.

pnpm functions differently in the 2 cases below:

[Issue #712]: https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/712 

### Store path is specified

If the store path is specified via [the store config](configuring), then copying
occurs between the store and any projects that are on a different disk.

If you run `pnpm install` on disk `A`, then the pnpm store must be on disk `A`.
If the pnpm store is located on disk `B`, then all required packages will be
directly copied to the project location instead of being linked. This severely
inhibits the storage and performance benefits of pnpm.

### Store path is NOT specified

If the store path is not set, then multiple stores are created (one per drive or
filesystem).

If installation is run on disk `A`, the store will be created on `A` at
`.pnpm-store`.  If later the installation is run on disk `B`, an independent
store will be created on `B` at `.pnpm-store`. The projects would still maintain
the benefits of pnpm, but each drive may have redundant packages.

## What does `pnpm store prune` do? Is it harmful?

The command `pnpm store prune` removes _unreferenced packages_.

Unreferenced packages are packages that are not used by any projects on the
system. Packages can become unreferenced after most installation operations, for
instance when dependencies are made redundant.

For example, during `pnpm install`, package `foo@1.0.0` is updated to
`foo@1.0.1`. pnpm will keep `foo@1.0.0` in the store, as it does not
automatically remove packages. If package `foo@1.0.0` is not used by any other
project on the system, it becomes unreferenced. Running `pnpm store prune` would
remove `foo@1.0.0` from the store.

Running `pnpm store prune` is not harmful and has no side effects on your
projects. If future installations require removed packages, pnpm will download
them again.

It is best practice to run `pnpm store prune` occasionally to clean up the
store, but not too frequently. Sometimes, unreferenced packages become required
again. This could occur when switching branches and installing older
dependencies, in which case pnpm would need to re-download all removed packages,
briefly slowing down the installation process.

## What does `pnpm` stand for?

`pnpm` stands for `performant npm`.
[Rico Sta. Cruz](https://github.com/rstacruz/) came up with the name.

## `pnpm` does not work with <YOUR-PROJECT-HERE>?

In most cases it means that one of the dependencies require packages not
declared in `package.json`. It is a common mistake caused by flat
`node_modules`. If this happens, this is an error in the dependency and the
dependency should be fixed. That might take time though, so pnpm supports
workarounds to make the buggy packages work.

### Solution 1

In the following example, a dependency does **not** have the `iterall` module in
its own list of deps.

The easiest solution to resolve missing dependencies of the buggy packages is to
**add `iterall` as a dependency to our project's `package.json`**.

You can do so, by installing it via `pnpm i iterall`, and will be automatically
added to your project's `package.json`.

```json
  "dependencies": {
    ...
    "iterall": "^1.2.2",
    ...
  }
```

### Solution 2

One of the solutions is to use [hooks](pnpmfile#hooks) for adding the missing
dependencies to the package's `package.json`.

An example was [Webpack Dashboard] which wasn't working with `pnpm`. It has
since been resolved such that it works with `pnpm` now.

It used to throw an error:

```console
Error: Cannot find module 'babel-traverse'
  at /node_modules/inspectpack/2.2.3/node_modules/inspectpack/lib/actions/parse
```

The problem was that `babel-traverse` was used in `inspectpack` which
was used by `webpack-dashboard`, but `babel-traverse` wasn't specified in
`inspectpack`'s `package.json`. It still worked with `npm` and `yarn` because
they create flat `node_modules`.

The solution was to create a `pnpmfile.js` with the following contents:

```js
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    readPackage: (pkg) => {
      if (pkg.name === "inspectpack") {
        pkg.dependencies['babel-traverse'] = '^6.26.0';
      }
      return pkg;
    }
  }
};
```

After creating a `pnpmfile.js`, delete `pnpm-lock.yaml` only - there is no need
to delete `node_modules`, as pnpm hooks only effect module resolution. Then,
rebuild the dependencies & it should be working.

### Solution 3

In case there are too many issues, you can use the `shamefully-hoist` option.
This creates a flat `node_modules` structure similar to the one created by `npm`
or `yarn`, which is not recommended as avoiding this structure is the primary
purpose of pnpm.

To use it, try `pnpm install --shamefully-hoist`.
