title: Command line tab-completion
---

Unlike other popular package managers, which usually require plugins, pnpm
supports command line tab-completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and similar shells.

To setup autocompletion, run:

```text
pnpm install-completion
```

The CLI will ask for which shell to generate the autocompletion script.
Alternatively, the target shell may be specified in the command line:

```text
pnpm install-completion zsh
```

To see examples of completion, read [this article].
