title: Command line tab-completion
---

Unlike other popular package managers, which usually require plugins, pnpm
supports command line tab-completion for Bash, Zsh, Fish, and similar shells.

To setup autocompletion for Bash, run:

```text
pnpm completion bash > ~/completion-for-pnpm.bash
echo 'source ~/completion-for-pnpm.bash' >> ~/.bashrc
```
