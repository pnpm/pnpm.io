### shellEmulator

* Default: **false**
* Type: **Boolean**

When `true`, pnpm will use a JavaScript implementation of a [bash-like shell] to
execute scripts.

This option simplifies cross-platform scripting. For instance, by default, the
next script will fail on non-POSIX-compliant systems:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "NODE_ENV=test node test.js"
}
```

But if the `shellEmulator` setting is set to `true`, it will work on all
platforms.
