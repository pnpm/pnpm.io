Aliases let you install packages with custom names.

Lets' assume you use `lodash` all over your project. There is a bug in `lodash` that breaks your project.
You have a fix but `lodash` won't merge it. Normally you would either install `lodash` from your fork
directly (as a git-hosted dependency) or publish it with a different name. If you use the second solution
you have to replace all the requires in your project with the new dependency name (`require('lodash')` => `require('awesome-lodash')`)`.
With aliases, you have a third option.

Publish a new package called `awesome-lodash` and install it using `lodash` as its alias:

```
pnpm add awesome-lodash@npm:lodash
```

No changes in code are needed. All the requires of `lodash` will import `awesome-lodash`.

Sometimes you'll want to use two different versions of a package in your project. Easy:

```sh
pnpm add lodash1@npm:lodash@1
pnpm add lodash2@npm:lodash@2
```

Now you can require the first version of lodash via `require('lodash1')` and the second via `require('lodash2')`.

This gets even more powerful when combined with hooks. Maybe you want to replace `lodash` with `awesome-lodash`
in all the packages in `node_modules`. You can easily achieve that with the following `pnpmfile.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  hooks: {
    readPackage
  }
}

function readPackage (pkg) {
  if (pkg.dependencies && pkg.dependencies.lodash) {
    pkg.dependencies.lodash = 'npm:awesome-lodash@^1.0.0'
  }
  return pkg
}
```
