title: Only allow pnpm

When you use pnpm on a project, you don't want others to accidentally run `npm install` or `yarn`.
To prevent devs from using other package managers, add the following `preinstall` script to your `package.json`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "preinstall": "npx only-allow pnpm"
  }
}
```

Next time, when someone runs `npm install` or `yarn install`, they'll get an error message in the console.
