### pnpm store add

### pnpm store prune

```sh
pnpm store prune
```

Pruning the store is not harmful, but might slow down future installations.

Please read [the FAQ](faq.md#what-does-pnpm-store-prune-do-is-it-harmful) for more information on unreferenced packages and `pnpm store prune` best practices.

> This command is prohibited when a [store server](cli/server) is running.
