This command is used by the standalone installation scripts of pnpm. For instance, in <https://get.pnpm.io/install.sh>.

Setup does the following actions:

* creates a home directory for the pnpm CLI
* adds the pnpm home directory to the `PATH` by updating the shell configuration file
* copies the pnpm executable to the pnpm home directory
