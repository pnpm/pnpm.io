Prepare a package for patching (inspired by a similar command in Yarn).

This command will cause a package to be extracted in a temporary directory intended to be editable at will.

Once you're done with your changes, run `pnpm patch-commit <path>` (with `<path>` being the temporary directory you received) to generate a patchfile and register it into your top-level manifest via the [`patchedDependencies`] field.

Usage:

```
pnpm patch <pkg name>@<version>
```

[`patchedDependencies`]: ../package_json.md#pnpmpatcheddependencies

## Options

### --edit-dir &lt;dir>

The package that needs to be patched will be extracted to this directory.

### --ignore-existing

Ignore existing patch files when patching.
