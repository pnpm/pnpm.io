title: pnpm publish
---

Publishes a package to the registry.

```sh
pnpm [-r] publish [<tarball|folder>] [--tag <tag>]
     [--access <public|restricted>]
```

When publishing a package inside a [workspace](../workspaces), the LICENSE file
from the root of the workspace is packed with the package (unless the package
has a license of its own).

You may override some fields before publish, using the
[publishConfig] field in `package.json`.

When running this command recursively (`pnpm -r publish`), pnpm will publish all
the packages that have versions not yet published to the registry.

[publishConfig]: ../package_json#publishconfig

## Options

### --tag &lt;tag\>

Publishes the package with the given tag. By default, `pnpm publish` updates
the `latest` tag.

For example:

```sh
# inside the foo package directory
pnpm publish --tag next
# in a project where you want to use the next version of foo
pnpm add foo@next
```

### --access &lt;public|restricted\>

Tells the registry whether the published package should be public or restricted.

### --force

Added in: v5.18.0

`pnpm publish -r --force` will try to publish packages even if their current version is already in the registry.

### git-checks

Added in: v4.11.0

* Default : **true** (since v5)
* Type: **Boolean**

When true, `pnpm publish` checks if the current branch is your publish branch
(master by default), clean, and up-to-date.

### publish-branch

Added in: v4.11.0

* Default: **master**
* Types: **String**

The primary branch of the repository which is used for publishing the latest
changes.

### --force

Added in: v5.18.0

Try to publish packages even if their current version is already found in the
registry or any other checks fail.

### --filter &lt;package_selector\>

Added in: 4.6.0
