Added support for excluding packages from trust policy and overriding the `engines` field on publish.

<!-- truncate -->

### Minor Changes

#### Trust policy exclusions

Added support for [`trustPolicyExclude`].

You can now list one or more specific packages or versions that pnpm should allow to install, even if those packages don't satisfy the trust policy requirement. For example:

```yaml
trustPolicy: no-downgrade
trustPolicyExclude:
  - chokidar@4.0.3
  - webpack@4.47.0 || 5.102.1
```

[`trustPolicyExclude`]: /settings#trustpolicyexclude

#### Override engines field on publish

Allow to override the `engines` field on publish by the `publishConfig.engines` field.

This allows you to specify different engine requirements for your published package than what you use during development.

### Patch Changes

- Don't crash when two processes of pnpm are hardlinking the contents of a directory to the same destination simultaneously [#10179](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10179).
