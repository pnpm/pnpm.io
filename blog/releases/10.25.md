pnpm 10.25 improves certificate handling, adds a bare `pnpm init`, and ships several quality-of-life fixes.

### Minor Changes

#### Per-registry certificates

You can now load inline certificates from the `cert`, `ca`, and `key` settings for specific registry URLs (for example, `//registry.example.com/:ca=-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----...`). Previously, pnpm only respected the `certfile`, `cafile`, and `keyfile` entries. This aligns pnpm with npm's `.npmrc` behavior [#10230](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10230).

#### `pnpm init --bare`

Added a `--bare` flag to `pnpm init` for creating a `package.json` with only the required fields [#10226](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10226).

### Patch Changes

- Improved reporting of ignored dependency scripts [#10276](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10276).
- `pnpm install` now builds any dependencies that were added to `onlyBuiltDependencies` but have not run their builds yet [#10256](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10256).
- `pnpm publish -r --force` will publish even if the version already exists in the registry, matching the intent of the flag [#10272](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10272).
- Avoid `ERR_PNPM_MISSING_TIME` errors when a package excluded from trust policy checks lacks the `time` field in its metadata.
