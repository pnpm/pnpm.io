pnpm now scales network concurrency automatically on high-core machines and ships several reliability fixes.

<!-- truncate -->

### Minor Changes

#### Adaptive network concurrency

Network concurrency now scales automatically between 16 and 64 based on the number of pnpm workers (workers × 3). This increases throughput on machines with many CPU cores while keeping resource usage predictable on smaller setups [#10068](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10068).

### Patch Changes

- `trustPolicy` now ignores trust evidences from prerelease versions when you install a non-prerelease version, so a trusted prerelease cannot block installing a stable release that lacks trust evidence.
- Handle `ENOENT` errors thrown by `fs.linkSync()`, which can occur in containerized environments (OverlayFS) instead of `EXDEV`. pnpm now gracefully falls back to `fs.copyFileSync()` in these cases [#10217](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/issues/10217).
- Reverted: `pnpm self-update` downloading pnpm from the configured npm registry [#10205](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/pull/10205).
- Packages that don't have a `package.json` file (like Node.js) are no longer reimported from the store on every install. pnpm now checks an additional file to verify the package in `node_modules`.
- Correctly read auth tokens for URLs that contain underscores [#17](https://github.com/pnpm/npm-conf/pull/17).
