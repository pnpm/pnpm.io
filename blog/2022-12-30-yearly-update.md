It is the end of the year. A really hard year. As you may know, I live in Ukraine, so due to Russia's war against us, it was harder to lead this project than in previous years. Nevertheless, it was a good year for pnpm. We've got a lot of new users, contributors, and we have implemented many great features.

## Usage

### Download Stats

My goal this year was to beat Lerna by the number of downloads. We were able to achieve this goal [in August](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=pnpm&package=lerna&from=2022-01-01&to=2022-12-30):

pnpm was downloaded more than [5 times more](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=pnpm&from=2016-12-01&to=2022-12-30) in 2022 than in 2021:

### Docs visits

We collect some unpersonalized stats from our docs using Google Analytics.
In 2022, sometimes we had more than 20,000 unique visitors a week. This is 10 times more than in 2021!

Our [main GitHub repository](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm) received almost +7,000 stars this year.

## Feature Highlights

### Supporting a symlinkless hoisted `node_modules` (since [v6.25.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v6.25.0))

Right at the beginning of 2022, we have added support for the "traditional" hoisted (a.k.a flat `node_modules`). We use Yarn's hoisting algorithm to create a proper hoisted `node_modules`. This new setting has basically made pnpm compatible with all Node.js stack that are compatible with npm CLI.

To use the hoisted `node_modules` directory structure, use the `node-linker=hoisted` setting in an `.npmrc` file.

### Side effects cache (since [v7.0.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v7.0.0))

Since v7, [side-effect-cache] is enabled by default, so dependencies that should be built are only built once on a machine. This improves installation speed by a lot in projects that have dependencies with build scripts.

[side-effect-cache]:  /npmrc#side-effects-cache

### Dependencies patching (since [v7.4.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v7.4.0))

The [`pnpm patch`] command have been added for patching dependencies in your `node_modules`.

[`pnpm patch`]: /cli/patch

### Time-based resolution strategy (since [v7.10.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v7.10.0))

A new resolution mode was added to pnpm, which should make updating dependencies more secure. You can change the resolution mode with the [resolution-mode] setting.

[resolution-mode]: https://pnpm.io/npmrc#resolution-mode

### Listing licenses of dependencies (since [v7.17.0](https://github.com/pnpm/pnpm/releases/tag/v7.17.0))

You may now use the [`pnpm licenses list`] command to check the licenses of the installed packages.

[`pnpm licenses list`]: /cli/licenses
