# Benchmarks of JavaScript Package Managers

**Last benchmarked at**: _Aug 14, 2026, 7:52 AM_ (_daily_ updated).

This benchmark compares the performance of npm, pnpm, Yarn, Yarn PnP, and Bun (check [Yarn's benchmarks](https://yarnpkg.com/benchmarks) for any other Yarn modes that are not included here). It then runs the same comparison again with every package manager installing through a pnpr registry over an emulated network, where pnpm can offload dependency resolution to the server. It also compares how fast pnpm, fnm, and nvm install and switch Node.js versions.

Each row's label lists which of `cache`, `lockfile`, and `node_modules` are warm/present before install runs. Quick mapping to the real world (ordered from slowest to fastest scenario):

- `clean`: a brand-new clone — nothing cached, no lockfile, no `node_modules`.
- `cache`: a developer reinstalling without a lockfile.
- `lockfile`: a CI server doing its first install.
- `cache+lockfile`: a developer reinstalling a known project.
- `cache+node_modules`: the lockfile is deleted and install is run again.
- `node_modules`: the cache and lockfile are deleted and install is run again.
- `lockfile+node_modules`: the cache is deleted and install is run again.
- `cache+lockfile+node_modules`: re-running install when nothing has changed.
- `update`: dependency versions are bumped in `package.json` and install is run again.

### pnpm vs pnpm 🦀

pnpm v12 will use a new installation engine for fetching and linking written in Rust. See [pacquet](https://github.com/pnpm/pacquet).

| ---     | ---   | ---      | ---         | --- | --- |

## Installing Through a Registry Server

The section above installs from the public npm registry over whatever link the benchmark machine happens to have. This one puts every package manager behind the same [pnpr](/pnpr) registry across an emulated 50ms round trip at 200 Mbit/s, and adds a row for pnpm resolving its dependency graph [on the server](/pnpr/install-acceleration) instead of walking it itself.

| action  | cache | lockfile | node_modules| npm | pnpm | [pnpm 🦀](https://github.com/pnpm/pacquet) | Yarn | Yarn PnP | Bun | [pnpm + pnpr](/pnpr/install-acceleration) |
| ---     | ---   | ---      | ---         | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| install |   |   |   | 58.4s | 8s | 2s | 7s | 3.6s | 4.1s | 5s |

How to read these numbers:

- **They are not comparable to the section above.** A different registry and an emulated network make these runs slower across the board. What they compare is the package managers against each other under one shared, reproducible network, not against their own numbers elsewhere on this page.
- **Every manager crosses the same link.** The registry round trip is applied to all of them, and to pnpm's resolution requests as well, so no client gets a cheaper connection than another.
- **pnpr's cache is warmed before anything is timed**, so no manager pays to pull the fixture into the registry on behalf of the ones measured after it.
- **Server-side resolution pays off when there is a graph to resolve.** Resolving one means walking it level by level, and each level costs a round trip, so the cost is roughly the depth of the graph times the latency. pnpr does that walk next to the registry and answers with the whole resolved lockfile at once, which is why the rows without a lockfile — and the row that changes dependencies — are the ones where it pulls ahead of plain pnpm.
- **It costs a round trip when there is not.** pnpm asks the server on every install, including the ones where the lockfile is already up to date and there is nothing to work out. The server answers a question it has been asked before from its cache, in a few milliseconds — what the client pays for is the round trip and having the resolved lockfile streamed back, which plain pnpm never pays because it never asks. That is why the rows with a lockfile come out slightly behind plain pnpm instead of level with it.
- Tarballs are still fetched by the client, in parallel and directly, on every row.

## Node.js Version Management

pnpm installs and switches Node.js versions itself, so a separate version manager is not needed. This section compares [`pnpm runtime set node`](/cli/runtime) with fnm and nvm.

| scenario | pnpm 12 | fnm | nvm |
| ---      | --- | --- | --- |
| install Node.js 24 with nothing cached | 1s | 2.3s | 3s |
| install Node.js 24 that was installed before | 189ms | 2.4s | 2.8s |
| run `node` in a project pinned to Node.js 22 | 8ms | 5ms | 93ms |

A few things to keep in mind when reading these numbers:

- pnpm keeps Node.js in its content-addressable store and nvm keeps the downloaded tarballs in `$NVM_DIR/.cache`, so for both of them installing a version that was installed before needs no download. fnm has no download cache and fetches Node.js again.
- pnpm doesn't extract the `npm`, `npx`, and `corepack` binaries bundled with Node.js, so on a clean install it downloads and writes fewer files than the other two.
- Per-project switching costs no command at all in pnpm: the `node` on your PATH is a shim that reads the [`devEngines.runtime`](/package_json#devenginesruntime) of the project and runs the matching version. fnm and nvm read a `.node-version` or `.nvmrc` file through a shell hook that fires on `cd`, which is what `fnm exec` and `nvm use` measure in that row. Loading nvm into the shell in the first place is not counted at all here, and it costs more than everything in that row.
- All three have to materialize the pinned version the first time a project asks for it: pnpm links it from its store, fnm downloads it, nvm unpacks it. The row measures the repeated runs after that.
